# sysLocation STRING

# sysName STRING
#    set the system location, system contact or system name (sysLocation.0, sysContact.0 and sysName.0) for the agent respectively. Ordinarily these objects are writeable via suitably authorized SNMP SET requests. However, specifying one of these directives makes the corresponding object read-only, and attempts to SET it will result in a notWritable error response.

# disk PATH [ MINSPACE | MINPERCENT% ]
#     monitors the disk mounted at PATH for available disk space.
#     The minimum threshold can either be specified in kB (MINSPACE) or as a percentage of the total disk (MINPERCENT% with a '%' character), defaulting to 100kB if neither are specified. If the free disk space falls below this threshold, then the corresponding dskErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable description message reported via the dskErrorMsg instance.

# includeAllDisks MINPERCENT%
#     configures monitoring of all disks found on the system, using the specified (percentage) threshold. The threshold for individual disks can be adjusted using suitable disk directives (which can come either before or after the includeAllDisks directive).
#     Note:
#         Whether disk directives appears before or after includeAllDisks may affect the indexing of the dskTable.
#     Only one includeAllDisks directive should be specified - any subsequent copies will be ignored.
#     The list of mounted disks will be determined when the agent starts using the getmntent(3), or getfsent(3) system calls. If none of the above system calls are available then the root partition "/" (which is assumed to exist on any UNIX based system) will be monitored. Disks mounted after the agent has started will not be monitored.
# If neither any disk directives or includeAllDisks are defined, then walking the dskTable will fail (noSuchObject).

# We do not want annoying "Connection from UDP: " messages in syslog.
# If the following option is commented out, snmpd will print each incoming
